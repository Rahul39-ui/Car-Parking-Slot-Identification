# Car-Parking-Slot-Identification

The Car Parking Slot Identification project is a computer vision-based solution designed to assist drivers in parking their vehicles efficiently. Developed as part of my undergraduate studies, this project addresses the challenges associated with parking in urban environments. The system utilizes object detection techniques to identify and classify available parking slots in real-time.

Key Features:
Real-time Object Detection:

The system employs the SSD ResNet algorithm for real-time object detection, allowing quick and accurate identification of parking slots.
User-Friendly Interface:

The project includes a user-friendly interface to provide a seamless experience for drivers. The interface displays real-time feedback on available parking slots.
Publication:

The findings and methodology of the Car Parking Slot Identification project were published in the International Organization of Scientific Research Journal of Computer Engineering (Vol. 25, Issue 1, pages 29â€“36).
